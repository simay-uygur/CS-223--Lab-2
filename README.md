# CS-223--Lab-2
This is a lab assignment given by Bilkent University in CS 223 (Digital Design) course.

SystemVerilog modules for full adder, full subtractor, and 2-bit adder and testbenches for each circuit type (behavioral and structural).

Also, a circuit to multiply a two-bit unsigned number by 3 using a single ripple-carry adder is implemented in the multiplier module.
